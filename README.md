# Classification of Arbitrages and Prediction of Sandwich Revenue in Uniswap Ethereum Transactions
_**Abstract**_

In recent years, the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies has led to a surge in blockchain-based transactions. With the rise in transaction volume, the possibility of arbitrage attacks has become a significant concern for users and developers. This mini project aims to address this issue by exploring the classification of arbitrage attacks and the prediction of sandwich revenue in Ethereum transactions. 
I have classified three types of attacks that are commonly observed in Ethereum transactions, namely front running, back running, and sandwich attacks. The classification was carried out by analyzing the transaction sequence and identifying the behaviors of the involved parties. I have also identified the specific characteristics that distinguish sandwich attacks from the other two types. 
In addition to classification, I also predicted the occurrence of sandwich attacks using various dataset attributes such as transaction hash, block number, and gas price. The prediction was done by employing machine learning techniques, and the results indicate a high level of accuracy. 
Furthermore, I have generated sandwich revenue by analyzing the profits made by the attackers in each attack instance. The generated revenue can be used to assess the impact of the attacks on the Ethereum network and to devise strategies for mitigating them. 
Overall, this mini project is a significant contribution to the study of arbitrage attacks in the Ethereum network. The project's findings provide valuable insights into the behaviors and characteristics of attackers, which can aid in the development of effective security measures.

_**Conclusion**_

In this project, I analyzed the Ethereum blockchain to identify and classify different types of arbitrage opportunities such as front running, back running, and sandwich attacks. I used various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, MLP, and XGBoost to detect sandwich attacks on Ethereum blockchain transactions. After tuning the hyperparameters of these models, I achieved the highest accuracy of above 76.4% in Random Forest. I also achieved lower accuracy in other ML models because of reasons like insufficient data and non-linearity.Then, I had developed a prediction model for the revenue generated through sandwich attacks.My approach involved analyzing the transaction data and identifying patterns that are characteristic of different types of arbitrage. I used support vector regression to build a predictive model and evaluated its performance using R² score.
The R2 values obtained from the prediction models provide us with a measure of how Ill the model fits the data. The R² value ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit and 0 indicating that the model does not explain any of the variability in the data. I used  different models: Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and XGBoost (XGB).
From the R2 values obtained, I can conclude that the XGBoost model performed the best, with an R2 value of 0.516594. This indicates that the XGBoost model was able to explain more than half of the variability in the data. The Linear Regression and MLP models both had R2 values of 0.033977, which indicates that they Ire not able to explain much of the variability in the data. The SVM model had a negative R2 value of -0.315305, which indicates that the model performed worse than the average model.
Based on these results, I can conclude that the XGBoost model is the best model for predicting the revenue generated from sandwich attacks. HoIver, the performance of the other models is not satisfactory and could be improved by using different parameters or by using other models altogether. It is important to note that these models Ire trained on a limited dataset and may not generalize Ill to other datasets. Therefore, further research is needed to validate the performance of these models on different datasets and to explore other models and techniques for predicting the revenue generated from sandwich attacks.
my findings suggest that sandwich attacks are a prevalent type of arbitrage in the Ethereum ecosystem, and there is significant revenue potential for traders who engage in this practice. Additionally, I observed that the predictive model was able to provide useful insights into the revenue potential of sandwich attacks, which can be leveraged by traders to optimize their trading strategies.
