# Classification of Arbitrages and Prediction of Sandwich Revenue in Uniswap Ethereum Transactions
This mini project focuses on the classification of arbitrage attacks and the prediction of sandwich revenue in Ethereum transactions. The project explores three types of attacks, namely front running, back running, and sandwich attacks, and provides a detailed analysis of their classification. Using the dataset attributes, we have predicted the occurrence of sandwich attacks and have also generated sandwich revenue. The project is significant in understanding and mitigating arbitrage attacks in the Ethereum network, thereby ensuring the security and stability of the platform.
